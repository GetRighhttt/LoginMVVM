# LoginMVVM

<p> Login Demo using mvvm. A basic example that turned out to look really<br>
nice. Easy implementation. Authentication with @AppStorage, and saves info<br>
using user defaults. Added some animations, a splash screen, and a nice color palette.<br>
Also added in a few alert dialog boxes for demo purposes.</p>
